## Landing page

> A landing page is an essential part of the website, that is why I tried to come up with an out-of-the-box web design that could help your customers be engaged with your product. To achieve that created an interacting element.  If you click on the Pepsi cans you can change the background.

Page hero section for Pepsi created with HTML, CSS and JS. Focusing on frontend and interaction.
